## ✅ My Submission
For this Flash Challenge, I created a **mini-game called "Find Tom 🐱"**.

### 🎮 Game Description
Tom the Cat 🐱 is hiding behind one of 5 doors 🚪.  
Your mission: **Find Tom!**  

- Click on a door to open it.  
- If you guess right 👉 you’ll see 🐱 and win 🎉.  
- If you guess wrong 👉 ❌ will show, and the correct door will be revealed.  
- Clean UI with hover effects, animations, and colorful feedback.
